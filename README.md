# REMOTE KEYLESS (STM32L4 + NRF24L01)

## Software Progress:
- [x] Handle Low Power Keyless 
- [x] Add IWDG to Keyless 
- [ ] ~~Handle migration from STM32L432KCUX to STM32L442KCUX~~ 
- [ ] Handle AES feature 
- [ ] How about pairing process ? 
- [ ] Rolling-Key for security ? 
- [x] Handle NRF24LE1 with 8051 MCU inside 

## Hardware Progress:
- [ ] ~~Consider the Microstrip Antenna performance~~ 
- [x] Check the schematic & board by you 
- [x] Change the MCU to witch support AES 
- [x] Make PCB for NRF24LE1 
- [x] Handle NRF24L01 micro-controller
